# Object Arrays (JavaScript)

The purpose of this exercise is to investigate the object arrays using the
technologies of JavaScript.  An example of the object array is the metals, which has properties of name, symbol and atomic number (written as atomic_number).

## UX

The array METALS has three properties `name, symbol and atomic_number`.

`name` is a string (e.g. Magnesium)
`symbol` is a string (e.g. Mg)
`atomic_number` is a number (e.g. 12)

    METALS = [

       
        {
            "name": "Magnesium",
            "symbol": "Mg",
            "atomic_number": 12
        },

       
    ];

As a user, I expect the element name (e.g. Magnesium) to be in bold type.

## Features

This exercise gives an idea of how to access the object arrays.  Useful in
future projects, which involve the use of object arrays.  For example, project
portfolio.

## Technologies

This exercise uses the technologies of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Google Fonts.  JavaScript is used to create and access object arrays.

## Testing

Ensure user stories have been met.

## Deployment

Deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://derektypist.github.io/object-arrays-js) at the main branch.
